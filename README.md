# Stardust High School Database

Stardust High is a fictional school that has recently opened and is looking to hit the ground running digitally. They have contacted a
database engineer to create the first version of what will be an expansive and much larger database in years to come.


This repository contains the queries used to create the database from the ground up, as well as the dummy data used to test it and the entity relatinonship diagram that guided its making.
